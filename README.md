# VertaBoard

VertaBoard (formerly VertaHub) is our team's submission to the Vertafore Intern Innovation challenge. VertaBoard is a community bulletin board that promotes collaboration, creativity, and communication within Vertafore. We took the classic idea of a community bulletin board and modernized it.
